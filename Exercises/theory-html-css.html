    <h1>Basic</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>What is HTML?
            <p>HyperText Markup Language - The language that is used to create and design Web pages. It describes web
                content. Uses tags to define elements in the Web page</p>
            <p>Markup Language: HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language, which means it is used to
                structure content on the web.</p>
            <p>Tags and Elements: HTML uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and
                other
                content on the page.</p>
            <p>Web Structure: HTML provides the basic structure of a website, including headers, footers,
                navigation menus, paragraphs, images, and links.</p>
            <p>No Logic or Interactivity: HTML by itself does not handle any logic or interactivity (like
                dynamic content or user interaction). JavaScript is typically used alongside HTML to add
                behavior, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>HTML Common Elements
            <ul>
                <li>Headings - h1,h2..h6</li>
                <li>Anchor links - a - used to create hyperlinks.
                    <ul>
                        <li>External: External hyperlinks link to pages or resources on different domains (e.g., linking
                            from your site to another site). Absolute hyperlinks include the full URL (e.g.,
                            https://www.example.com/page.html)</li>
                        <li>Local: Local hyperlinks (also called internal hyperlinks) link to pages or resources within
                            the same website or domain.
                        </li>
                        <div>Relative hyperlinks: The term relative hyperlink typically refers to how the URL is
                            written,
                            not necessarily whether the link is local or external. A relative hyperlink is a type of
                            link that points to a resource (file or page) within the same website or domain. Relative
                            hyperlinks use a path that is relative to the current page or directory.
                            <ul>
                                <li> A <strong>root-relative</strong> path starts from the root directory of the
                                    website. It always begins with a forward slash (/), indicating the root of the
                                    website. href="/about.html". This link will always go to
                                    https://www.yourwebsite.com/about (assuming the siteâ€™s domain is yourwebsite.com),
                                    no matter where the link is placed in the folder structure. The /about path is from
                                    the root directory of the website.</li>
                                <li>Document-Relative path with <strong>parent .//</strong> directory
                                    href="../portfolio/portfolio.html" Each ../ moves up one level in the folder
                                    hierarchy.</li>
                                <li>Document-Relative path with <strong>current</strong> directory ./ It's not necessary
                                    to
                                    include ./ when referencing files in the same directory, but it can be used
                                    explicitly. href="contact.html"</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The link href="#exercise" is a type of anchor link (also called fragment identifier). It
                                links to a specific section or element within the same page.
                                The href attribute specifies the destination of the link.</p>
                            <p>The # symbol is used to indicate an internal link, meaning it will scroll the page to the
                                location where the element with the ID "exercises" is placed.</p>
                        </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>src - Specifies the URL or path to the image file you want to display. This can be an
                            absolute
                            URL (e.g., https://example.com/image.jpg) or a relative URL (e.g., images/photo.jpg).</li>
                        <li>alt (alternative text):

                            Provides a text description of the image. This is used for:
                            Accessibility: Screen readers will read the alt text to help visually impaired users.
                            SEO: Search engines use the alt text to understand the image content.
                            Fallback: If the image fails to load, the alt text will be displayed in its place.</li>
                        <li>width and height - If they are not set - the image appears in its original size.</li>
                        <li>title (optional): Adds a tooltip when the user hovers over the image. This can be a useful
                            way to provide additional information about the image.</li>
                        <li>loading (optional):
                            Specifies whether the image should be loaded immediately or lazily (i.e., when it comes into
                            view on the user's screen).
                            Use loading="lazy" to defer loading the image until the user scrolls near it, improving page
                            load time and performance.</li>
